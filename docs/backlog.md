# Backlog

Findings from a three-lens review (robustness/security, testing/operations,
product/features) conducted July 2026, plus the remainder of the performance
review that preceded it. Every item below was verified against the code at the
time of writing — file references are from that review. Items are removed as
they ship; see CHANGELOG.md for what already landed.

For longer-horizon feature direction, see `roadmap-2.0.md`. This document is
narrower: concrete, verified gaps in what exists today.

## Recently addressed (for context)

> Released in **v1.34.0** (2026-07-14): repository metadata caching, offline
> metadata serving, LAN server mode, offline cached-`.deb` serving, and
> daemon-side upstream GPG verification (all detailed below). Earlier entries
> shipped in v1.32.0–v1.33.0; see `CHANGELOG.md` for the per-release breakdown.

- v1.32.0 shipped three soak-validated performance batches (PRs #88–#90):
  fleet claim-window latency, real WAL mode, streaming mirror downloads,
  cache lock contention, index re-parse leak, stall-based timeouts,
  conditional GETs, log-noise cleanup.
- PR #92: chunked downloads write each byte once; parallel reannounce; fleet
  send deadlines.
- PR #93: download-state garbage collection (was dead code), cache self-heal
  after DB-corruption recovery (was: 500s until manual rebuild), eviction and
  peer-blacklist metrics, systemd watchdog (`Type=notify` + `WatchdogSec`),
  lz4/zstd/bz2 index support, CI watchdog-recovery test.
- v1.33.0 (2026-07-13): the reliability release — the apt-fallback drop-in (PR
  #94) resolves the former product gap "APT breaks when the daemon is down": the
  `.deb` now applies the proxy via `Proxy-Auto-Detect` with a liveness probe, so
  a stopped/crashed/removed daemon degrades to `DIRECT` instead of failing every
  `apt` operation (CI-tested each build).
- Trust-model honesty pass: reworded the overstated "cryptographically
  verified" / "signed index" / "a trusted host cannot serve a tampered package"
  claims across README, SECURITY.md, the docs, config examples, and code
  comments to state the real model — APT's client-side verification is the
  guarantee by default. (This was the doc half of former robustness/security #1;
  the optional daemon-side code hardening has since shipped too — see
  "Daemon-side upstream GPG verification" below.)
- **Repository metadata caching** (PR #98, resolves former product gap "metadata
  is never cached"): Release/InRelease, Packages/Sources, Translation, Contents,
  and DEP-11 are now cached in the (previously dead) `indices` table with their
  own LRU disk budget. A cold client revalidates against the local cache with a
  cheap conditional GET instead of re-downloading tens of MB per update;
  immutable `by-hash` files skip the upstream round-trip entirely, and cached
  Packages bytes re-warm the in-memory index after a restart. `[cache]
  cache_metadata` / `metadata_max_size`; metrics `debswarm_metadata_cache_*`.
- **Offline metadata serving** (PR #99, partially resolves the offline-mode gap):
  when the mirror is unreachable (network down, mirror outage, or the
  connectivity monitor reporting offline) the proxy serves the last cached
  metadata instead of failing `apt-get update`, marked `X-Debswarm-Stale: true`;
  an offline monitor short-circuits the doomed upstream call. APT still verifies
  the GPG signature and `Valid-Until`, so this is not a trust regression.
  `[cache] serve_stale_metadata` (default on); metric
  `debswarm_metadata_cache_stale_served_total`.
- **LAN cache-server mode** (resolves former product gap #1): the proxy can bind
  to a LAN interface (`[network] proxy_bind`) so a fleet shares one cache. The
  trust story is fail-closed — a non-loopback bind requires an explicit client
  CIDR allowlist (`[network] proxy_allowed_cidrs`) or the daemon refuses to start;
  the allowlist matches the client's real connection address (X-Forwarded-For is
  never trusted) and loopback is always allowed. When set it also gates the admin
  read surface, closing robustness/security #5 (metrics inventory leak) for
  opted-in operators. Design:
  `docs/design/lan-server-mode.md`.
- **Daemon-side upstream GPG verification** (PRs #104 design + #105 impl;
  **resolves former robustness/security #1** — the doc-honesty half landed in the
  trust-model pass above, this is the code half): the daemon can verify each
  repository's GPG-signed `Release` against a trusted keyring and each `Packages`
  index against it, anchoring every `.deb` hash to GPG rather than the mirror.
  `[security] verify_upstream_signatures`: `off`, `warn` (verify and report via
  `debswarm_upstream_verify_total`, a log, and an `X-Debswarm-Unverified` header,
  but always serve), `auto` (**the default** — refuse an index only when a
  signature-verified `Release` proves it was tampered with, and serve-and-report
  like `warn` when verification cannot be attempted), or `enforce` (refuse every
  unverified index, fail-closed). Keys auto-discovered from APT's keyrings; reads
  the signed `Release` from the metadata cache, so it needs `[cache] cache_metadata`
  (`auto`/`warn` degrade to serve-and-report if it or a keyring is missing; only
  `enforce` fails startup). Closes the `[trusted=yes]` / `dpkg -i` / P2P-seed gap
  for every repo whose key is discoverable, by default. Design:
  `docs/design/upstream-gpg-verification.md`. Dependency `ProtonMail/go-crypto`.
  Follow-ups since done: flat/no-`dists` repos are now verified against the
  `Release` in their own directory (any repo with a discoverable **v4**-signed
  `Release`), including their `Acquire-By-Hash` `Packages` indices; the default
  `https_upstream_hosts` set was widened to the common HTTPS repos; and `enforce`
  now **fetches a missing `Release` on demand** (dedup'd + negatively cached) so it
  no longer refuses a verifiable index when the `Release` was not already cached
  (e.g. a client-side `304` relay). **`pkgs.k8s.io` still cannot be verified** — it
  signs `InRelease` with a **legacy v3 signature** that go-crypto refuses (only
  GnuPG accepts v3); k8s is served-and-flagged `no-release` under `auto`, needs
  `verify_exempt_hosts` under `enforce`. Not fixable without adding v3 support (a
  security regression); a v4 re-sign is an upstream OBS matter.
- **Real-APT end-to-end CI test** (PR #109, partially addresses testing/ops #2):
  a new `e2e` job drives a real apt client through the proxy against a real
  Debian repo in a `debian:bookworm-slim` container, guarding the pipelining /
  `ReadTimeout` hang class (a large index fetched with `timeout`), the metadata
  cache (cold miss → warm hit), and default (`auto`) signature verification.
  Institutionalizes the manual Docker soak; committed under `test/e2e/`. Still
  open in testing/ops #2: fuzz-in-CI, two-node P2P, nightly.
- **Source-package verification** (Unreleased, resolves former product gap #4):
  a new `Sources` parser (`internal/index/sources.go`) reads the
  `Checksums-Sha256` block of each stanza, so `.dsc`/`.orig.tar.*`/
  `.debian.tar.*`/`.diff.gz`, native tarballs, and `.orig-<component>` tarballs
  now classify as content-addressed packages and flow through the existing
  cache/verify/P2P path (SHA256 from the index, DHT-announced, peer-served) — the
  binary-`.deb` machinery is reused unchanged. `Sources` indices are GPG-verified
  by the same `verifyIndex`/`Release` path as `Packages` (plain + `Acquire-By-Hash`),
  and the apt-lists watcher warms the in-memory index from `deb-src` `Sources`
  files at startup. Fuzz-tested (`FuzzParseSourcesFile`).

## Product gaps (ranked by user value)

1. **`lan_only` mode: mirror suppression in the download racing path.** Offline
   `.deb` serving now works — cached metadata serves offline (PR #99), the
   in-memory index re-warms from cache after a restart, `apt-get install` of an
   already-cached package is served from disk offline, and a genuine miss while
   offline fails fast with 503 (all shipped). What remains is explicit `lan_only`
   gating: `downloadPackage` still builds a mirror source and runs the final
   mirror fallback even in `ModeLANOnly`, so a LAN-only node can still reach the
   WAN. The fix belongs inside `downloadPackage` (nil the mirror source for the
   parallel downloader and skip the final mirror `Stream`), but it touches the
   racing path — deferred to keep the offline change low-risk.
2. **Cross-NAT P2P doesn't work; docs claim it does.** Only the relay client
   transport and hole punching are enabled — no AutoRelay reservation logic,
   and no debswarm node ever runs the relay service, so DCUtR has no relayed
   connection to coordinate through. Two NAT'd peers can never connect.
   **`EnableHolePunching()` is therefore effectively dead code**: it is enabled
   and advertised, but DCUtR only fires over an existing relayed connection, and
   nothing ever obtains the reservation that would create one. A second problem
   sits behind the first — even with AutoRelay on, *there is no relay to reserve
   on*, since no debswarm node runs the relay service and the libp2p bootstrap
   nodes do not offer open circuit-v2 reservations. **Designed in
   `docs/design/cross-nat-p2p.md`** (AutoRelay + `relay_service = auto` on
   publicly-reachable nodes + `relay_peers` static config; relays are used only
   to hole-punch, never to carry package bytes; includes a real NAT test topology,
   because the current Docker-bridge soak cannot see this bug at all).
   `docs/comparison.md` states this honestly today (Relay Fallback: "Partial —
   client transport only") and stays that way until the implementation lands.
3. **No signed apt repository for debswarm itself.** ✅ **Done** (v1.39.0). The
   signed apt repo is **live at `https://clintcan.github.io/debswarm/`** —
   `apt-get install debswarm` works, the repo is GPG-signed, carries
   amd64/arm64/armhf, and is republished automatically by the `apt-repo` job on
   every stable tag. Verified end-to-end in a clean container (apt verified the
   signature; origin `o=debswarm,n=stable` matches the documented
   `unattended-upgrades` pattern). The multi-arch container image
   (`ghcr.io/clintcan/debswarm`, distroless) shipped in v1.37.0 and is public.
   Self-distribution is complete; see `docs/design/self-distribution.md`. No Helm
   chart exists (lower priority).
4. **Source packages get zero benefit.** ✅ **Done** (Unreleased — see Recently
   addressed and `CHANGELOG.md`). `Sources` indices are now parsed and each
   `.dsc`/`.orig.tar.*`/`.debian.tar.*`/`.diff.gz` (plus native and
   `.orig-<component>` tarballs) is cached, SHA256-verified against the index,
   and P2P-shared through the same path as a `.deb`; `Sources` indices are also
   GPG-verified. Build farms now get the full benefit.
5. **Smaller**: `rollback fetch` from P2P is a stub while the README
   advertises it; no mirror remapping/failover (per-mirror stats are
   collected but never used for selection); no per-repo cache stats or
   quotas; cache pinning is by SHA256 prefix only.

## Robustness / security

1. **Peer blacklisting is in-memory and Sybil-trivial.** A restart clears all
   blacklists; an offender reconnects under a fresh peer ID. Verification
   prevents poisoning, so this is a deterrence gap, not a correctness one.
   Persistent reputation or per-IP throttling would raise attacker cost.
2. **No default upload-bandwidth cap.** Upload concurrency is slot-limited
   (20 global / 4 per peer) but `max_upload_rate` defaults to unlimited; a
   few peers repeatedly requesting large cached packages can saturate a
   node's uplink.
3. **Corruption-recovery orphan accounting.** PR #93 made orphaned entries
   self-heal on access, but orphaned files that are never re-requested still
   escape size accounting and eviction until a `cache rebuild`. A post-
   recovery automatic rebuild (or startup orphan sweep) would finish the job.
4. **Fleet message hash validation.** `handleFetching` inserts entries keyed
   by unvalidated remote input (any string up to 1024 bytes). Bounded by the
   message queue and reaper, and fleet peers are LAN/PSK-scoped — but
   validating 64-hex on ingest is cheap defense-in-depth.
5. **Metrics endpoints leak the package inventory when bound non-locally.**
   Mutating API routes are loopback-gated; `GET /api/cache/packages*`,
   `/stats`, and `/dashboard` are not. Binding to `0.0.0.0` is warned about
   in logs but exposes the full installed-package list.
6. **Upstream verification: remaining coverage gaps (follow-up to the shipped
   feature).** Daemon-side GPG verification landed and now defaults to `auto` (see
   Recently addressed), so out of the box the proxy refuses an index a
   signature-verified `Release` proves was tampered with, for every repo whose key
   is discoverable — now including **flat/no-`dists` repos** (incl. their
   `Acquire-By-Hash` indices), and the default `https_upstream_hosts` set was
   **widened** to the common HTTPS repos. `enforce` now **fetches a missing
   `Release` on demand** (dedup'd + negatively cached) so it no longer refuses a
   verifiable index when the `Release` was not already cached. Remaining: only
   **`pkgs.k8s.io` is unverifiable**, because it uses a **legacy v3 `InRelease`
   signature** go-crypto refuses (served under `auto`, `verify_exempt_hosts` under
   `enforce`) — an upstream signature-format issue, not fixable without a
   security-regressing v3 code path. This item is otherwise **done**.

## Testing / operations

1. **Coverage holes where failures live**: `internal/proxy` ~49% overall with
   the CONNECT tunnel, retry worker, and `handleHealth` near 0%;
   `cmd/debswarm` ~23% (daemon lifecycle, SIGHUP reload untested).
2. **CI**: the real-APT e2e now exists (PR #109: the `e2e` job drives a real apt
   client through the proxy against a real Debian repo, covering the pipelining
   blind spot + metadata cache + default verification — see Recently addressed).
   Still open: the three fuzz targets and committed corpus never run in CI; no
   two-node P2P job; no nightly; the Codecov check is informational only.
3. **SQLite schema versioning**: no `PRAGMA user_version`; migrations swallow
   errors (`_, _ = db.Exec(ALTER …)`); an old binary against a new schema is
   undetected and untested.
4. **Graceful shutdown holes**: the metrics HTTP server is never shut down;
   hijacked CONNECT tunnels are invisible to `http.Server.Shutdown` and get
   hard-killed.
5. **`/health` is liveness-only**: degraded states (`dht: no_peers`,
   `p2p: no_connections`) are reported but never flip the status, so
   orchestrators cannot see degradation. (The systemd watchdog added in
   PR #93 covers hangs, not degradation.)
6. **`--log-file` has no rotation** (the audit log does). SIGHUP reload
   applies only rate limits and silently ignores every other config change.
7. **Docs**: no production sizing/capacity guidance (`MemoryMax=512M` is
   hardcoded in the unit with no rationale); `scripts/install.sh` and README
   still show the older `DynamicUser` unit variant, inconsistent with the
   packaged hardened unit (and install.sh must stay `Type=simple` until a
   release with sd_notify support ships).

## Performance (remainder)

1. **Fleet LAN downloads buffer the whole file in memory** — `p2pNode.Download`
   returns `[]byte`; fixing it needs a streaming P2P transfer API. Deferred
   from the 2026-07 performance batches as the only remaining structural item.
2. Smaller: per-chunk 4MB allocations bypass any pooling (shape depends on
   the streaming API above). (The `indices` table, formerly dead schema, is now
   the metadata cache — see Recently addressed.)

## Verified fine (don't re-audit without cause)

SSRF/redirect/CONNECT validation including DNS-rebind re-checks; P2P transfer
frame hardening (size caps, fixed-length decode, allocation caps, deadlines);
path-traversal guards on cache keys; disk-full handling in the cache write
path; identity/PSK file permissions; the packaged systemd unit hardening;
fuzz targets with committed corpus; in-process two-node e2e tests; the
ReadTimeout regression guard; by-hash and flat-repo handling; Ubuntu phased
updates (client-side, nothing for the proxy to do).
