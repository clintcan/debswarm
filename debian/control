Description: Peer-to-peer package distribution for APT
 debswarm accelerates APT package downloads by fetching packages from
 nearby peers while maintaining security through cryptographic verification.
 It operates as a transparent HTTP proxy, requiring no changes to your
 normal apt workflow.
 .
 Features:
  * Transparent APT integration - just use apt install as usual
  * P2P package sharing via libp2p and Kademlia DHT
  * Parallel chunked downloads from multiple peers
  * Hash verification against signed repository metadata
  * Automatic fallback to official mirrors
  * QUIC transport for better NAT traversal
  * Prometheus metrics for monitoring
